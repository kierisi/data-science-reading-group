## The Data Science Community Reading Group  

----------

[The Data Science Community Reading Group](https://community.baseten.co/c/reading-group/12) 
is an online, asynchronous reading group that is open to everyone, regardless of 
programming language or data science expertise. 
The goal of this group is for all of us - data scientists and friends of data 
science - to connect, explore, and discuss a wide range of data science and 
machine learning content. 
And sure, while the title says reading group, weâ€™re not limiting ourselves to 
the written word. 
Everything is fair game, from books to blogs to videos and everything in between.

### How it works
There are always two reading groups in session: a bi-weekly group that focuses on
shorter content, and a monthly group that focuses on longer content (usually a 
chapter book). 

**Bi-weekly reading group**  

* All content in the bi-weekly reading group will only use content that is online 
and open-access, meaning that there will never be a cost associated with accessing 
the content.
* Content for the bi-weekly reading group will be shorter in nature than the 
monthly reading group, and generally not exceed 50 pages for written content.  
* Every other Monday (Tuesdays when there's a US holiday) we'll post a poll with 
four options from the open access section of our [full-reading-list.md file](https://github.com/kierisi/data-science-reading-group/blob/main/full-reading-list.md).  
* The poll will stay open until 10AM Central on Thursday of the same week, at which
time a general discussion thread will be posted in the [Reading Group category](https://community.baseten.co/c/reading-group/12).  
* You're welcome to respond to the general discussion thread, or to start your 
own topic related to the reading.

#### Monthly reading group   

* The monthly reading group will be focused on a chapter book, and may require 
participants to purchase the book, rent it from the library, or borrow it from a 
friend or colleague.  
* Content for the monthly reading group will be longer and require more of a time 
investment from participants, although there's no requirement to read the entire 
book in order to participate.  
* The first Monday of each month (Tuesdays when there's a US holiday) we'll post 
a poll with four options from the paid section of our [full-reading-list.md file](https://github.com/kierisi/data-science-reading-group/blob/main/full-reading-list.md).  
* The poll will stay open until 10AM Central on Thursday of the same week, at which 
point anyone interested in participating should make arrangements to purchase or 
borrow the book.  
* The first day of the following month a general discussion thread will be posted 
in the [Reading Group category](https://community.baseten.co/c/reading-group/12).  
* You're welcome to respond to the general discussion thread for the book, and 
encouraged to start your own topic related to the reading!

### Joining [The Data Science Community](community.baseten.co)
All of our conversations will be happening asynchronously on [The Data Science 
Community](community.baseten.co) Discourse forum, hosted by [Baseten](baseten.co). 
While you do not have to join the community to read along or see the conversations
that others are having, you do have to join the community if you'd like to 
participate in the conversation.
